    <p>
      Leiout’s revenues have risen to an estimated $250,000+ while the cost of
      running the tournament may be as low as a tenth of that, and its finances
      are a black box. This year a group of players who believe that we should
      be seeing a lot more value for all that money are starting a new beach
      tournament, {{#ext-a urls.throwback}}LA Throwback{{/ext-a}}, that will be
      held the same weekend in Santa Monica – read their statement
      {{#ext-a urls.whyThrowback}}here{{/ext-a}}.
    </p>
    <p>
      Brian Calle, the president of the organization that runs Leiout, is
      politically conservative and has ties to a number of right wing
      organizations, including being a primary actor in the recent purchase of
      the {{#ext-a urls.laWeekly}}L.A. Weekly{{/ext-a}}, an award-winning
      independent local newspaper, and the subsequent firing of all of its
      staff.
    </p>
    <p>
      Opinions vary widely on how relevant Calle’s politics are to the
      tournament and Ultimate community and on how much is reasonable for
      tournament staff to be paid, but given that there’s potentially upwards of
      $200,000 of profits, it’s very fair to ask whether everything is as it
      should be. The purpose of this web site is to ask that question, provide
      some context and relevant info for you to come up with your own answer,
      and then provide some ideas for what you might do if you think everything
      is not as it should be.

      my likely biases are.

  {{#content-section id="budget" title="Leiout Budget"}}
    <p>
      Last year Leiout had
      {{#ext-a urls.leioutBrackets}}384 teams{{/ext-a}}. Estimating an average
      of 13 players per team (just under 3 lines) paying the $50 bid fee, that’s
      $249,600.
    </p>
    <p>
      The fees paid to the city for the use of the beach were
      {{#ext-a urls.redditPermits}}under $7,500{{/ext-a}}. There are certainly
      other significant expenses such as insurance, the open bar tabs for the
      parties and others mentioned in the
      {{#ext-a urls.leioutFaq}}Leiout FAQ{{/ext-a}}, but there seems to be no
      reason to believe that they would come anywhere close to the gap between
      the $7,500 field expenses and the $250,000 in revenue.
    </p>
    <p>
      The {{#ext-a urls.leioutFaq}}Leiout FAQ{{/ext-a}} refers to charitable
      contributions, specifically mentioning {{#ext-a urls.laout}}LAOUT{{/ext-a}}
      and {{#ext-a urls.eric}}E.R.I.C.{{/ext-a}}
      {{#ext-a urls.laout}}LAOUT{{/ext-a}} receives 5% of Leiout's revenues
      according to their
      {{#ext-a urls.laoutMinutesAugust}}August 2017 minutes{{/ext-a}} (section
      g), and I have an email out to {{#ext-a urls.eric}}E.R.I.C.{{/ext-a}}
      asking how much they receive from Leiout.
    </p>
    <p>
      So, it appears highly plausible that the lion's share of that $250,000 is
      either going to pay the staff, or being donated to other non-Ultimate
      organizations. The {{#ext-a urls.leioutFaq}}Leiout FAQ{{/ext-a}} claims
      that the staff are not being paid six digits, but given the numbers above,
      this leaves more questions than answers about where all the revenue is
      actually going.
    </p>
    <p>
      Given Brian Calle's political positions and organizational
      affiliations, those of us that don't want our bid fees to be supporting
      right-wing causes seem justified in asking for some transparency as to the
      specifics of where all of that money is going.
    </p>

  {{#content-section id="calle" title="Brian Calle"}}
    <p>
      Brian Calle is the lead organizer of Leiout, and his
      {{#ext-a urls.calleLinkedIn}}LinkedIn profile{{/ext-a}} lists him as the
      president of Lei-Out Ultimate, presumably the corporate entity that puts
      on Leiout. His conservative politics are
      {{#ext-a urls.calWatchdog}}no secret{{/ext-a}}. He is also:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Former Vice President and Senior Fellow at the
        {{#ext-a urls.claremont}}Claremont Institute{{/ext-a}},
        a conservative think tank.
      </li>
      <li>
        A former speaker at an {{#ext-a urls.familyActionPacEvent}}event{{/ext-a}}
        put on by the {{#ext-a urls.familyActionPac}}Family Action PAC{{/ext-a}},
        a self-proclaimed socially conservative organization whose mission
        includes opposing abortion and upholding "traditional family values."
      </li>
      <li>
        A (former?) Senior Fellow at the
        {{#ext-a urls.pacificResearch}}Pacific Research Institute{{/ext-a}}, another
        conservative think tank.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Late last year he was also a primary actor in buying the
      {{#ext-a urls.laWeekly}}L.A. Weekly{{/ext-a}}, an independent newspaper in
      L.A. with an award-winning staff, all of whom were subsequently fired.
      Speculation is that the intent is to turn the paper into a conservative
      mouthpiece, but of course we don't realy know yet.
      {{#ext-a urls.laWeeklySnopes}}Here{{/ext-a}} is a good summary of what
      happened, and {{#ext-a urls.laWeeklyDeadspin}}here{{/ext-a}} is a deeper
      analysis of it, and its implications for the paper and journalism in L.A.
    </p>
    <p>
      Again, the point of this information isn't to imply that the entire
      Ultimate community leans or should lean left, or to villify Brian Calle,
      or to claim that there's something wrong with him running Leiout. Rather,
      it is to try to paint a clear picture of his politics so you can decide
      for yourself if it affects your comfort level with the uncertainty around
      where all the Leiout revenue goes when he's apparently in complete control
      of the budget and finances.
    </p>
  {{/content-section}}
  {{#content-section id="laout" title="LAOUT"}}
    <p>
      {{#ext-a urls.laout}}LAOUT{{/ext-a}} is the non-profit in L.A. that runs
      most of the local leagues and tournaments. It has no organizational ties
      to Leiout other than receiving a small cut of the revenues, although a few
      of the member of its board also help to run Leiout. As is apparent from
      the below links from this site to their meeting minutes, the organization
      operates very transparently.
    </p>
    <p>
      It seems that there was an effort last year to get
      {{#ext-a urls.laout}}LAOUT{{/ext-a}} to "take over" Leiout by running its
      own beach tournament the same weekend. According to their
      {{#ext-a urls.laoutMinutes2016}}August 2016 minutes{{/ext-a}} they
      refused, and have also refused to promote
      {{#ext-a urls.throwback}}LA Throwback{{/ext-a}} according to their
      {{#ext-a urls.laoutMinutesAugust}}August 2017 minutes{{/ext-a}} minutes
      (see their {{#ext-a urls.laoutMinutesMay}}May 2017 minutes{{/ext-a}} for
      more discussion of the issue.)
    </p>
    <p>
      I have heard rumors of a plan to turn Leiout over to
      {{#ext-a urls.laout}}LAOUT{{/ext-a}} in the next couple of years, but have
      been unable to find any written indication of this plan. This could
      presumably be a big boon to the organization and L.A. area Ultimate if
      they are able to use more than 5% of Leiout's revenues for their budget
      and operations, and it seems almost certain that they would provide the
      financial transparency that has been lacking.
    </p>
  {{/content-section}}
  {{#content-section id="action" title="Take Action?"}}
    <p>
      The point of all of this has been to shed some light on the situation
      surrounding Leiout's financials so that you can decide if you're fine with
      the situation, or if, like me, you are worried that things are not as they
      should be. I certainly don't think there's conclusive evidence of any kind
      of wrongdoing, but I also can't manage to convince myself that there
      isn't. Given the uncertaintly around where the estimated $250,000 in
      revenue is going, here are some questions I propose we ask ourselves:
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Do we as a community have a right to know what an organization putting
        on a tournament does with our bid fees?
      </li>
      <li>
        Do we as a community have a right to have any input into what such an
        organization does with our bid fees?
      </li>
      <li>
        Is there an amount of money that tournament staff could be personally
        making on a tournament that is inappropriate? Of so, how much might that
        be?
      </li>
      <li>
        Should the personal politics and organizational affiliations of
        tournament staff factor in when considering the above questions?
      </li>
    </ol>
    <p>
      If your answers to those questions leads to you be uncomfortable with our
      current situation, as I am, here are some ideas of what you might do about
      it:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Stop giving Leiout your bid fees. Don't attend, or attend
        {{#ext-a urls.throwback}}LA Throwback{{/ext-a}} instead.
      </li>
      <li>
        Contact the Leiout staff at
        {{#ext-a "leioutultimate@gmail.com"}}leioutultimate@gmail.com{{/ext-a}}
        or through social media and ask them to provide more transparency
        regarding their finances.
      </li>
      <li>
        Email Andy Bandit, the president of {{#ext-a urls.laout}}LAOUT{{/ext-a}}
        at {{#ext-a "president@laout.org"}}president@laout.org{{/ext-a}} or the
        {{#ext-a "laoutBoard"}}other board members{{/ext-a}} and express your
        discomfort with Leiout's opaque finances, and express your support for
        {{#ext-a urls.laout}}LAOUT{{/ext-a}} itself running Leiout.
